**JRUBY multithreaded** Elixir Sips Downloader
======================

Elixir Sips Downloader downloads all episodes and attachments, 
organizes them for later use and keeps an easy to use index of episodes.

This is just a simple modification of [@leafac's](https://github.com/leafac) [ruby-tapas-downloader](https://github.com/leafac/ruby-tapas-downloader). 

All credit should go to him. :)
